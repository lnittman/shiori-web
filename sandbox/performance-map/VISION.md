# Performance Map: Vision & Rationale

## The Enhancement
A simple 2D world map displaying the cities where Shiori has performed. Hovering over a pin reveals a small card with a video or image and performance details.

## Discovery Process
The performances data already includes locations and media. A 2D map felt like a natural way to showcase these while fitting with the existing flat design of the site.

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Alternative 1: 3D Globe
- **Core Idea**: Render the locations on an interactive 3D globe.
- **Potential Value**: Provides a striking visual effect.
- **Why Not Selected**: Introduces heavier dependencies and felt out of place with the current UI.

### Alternative 2: Timeline View
- **Core Idea**: Display performances in chronological order along a timeline.
- **Potential Value**: Emphasizes career progression.
- **Why Not Selected**: Doesn't highlight the geographic spread.

## Future Development Opportunities
- Use a more detailed map asset for better visual accuracy.
- Allow filtering or clustering of markers as the list grows.
