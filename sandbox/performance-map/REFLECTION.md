# Performance Map: Implementation Reflection

## Domain Insights
Mapping performance locations visually helps highlight Shiori's international presence without overwhelming the existing layout.

## Architecture Observations
The project already uses React and `framer-motion`, making it straightforward to add hover animations without new dependencies.

## Integration Considerations
The map can be lazily loaded on pages to avoid adding weight to the initial bundle. Marker interactions can link to existing performance detail routes.

## Enhancement Value
This feature gives visitors a quick geographic overview of Shiori's performances while fitting naturally with the site's UI.

## Next Steps
- Replace the placeholder SVG with a more detailed map asset.
- Add clustering or filtering when more locations are available.
